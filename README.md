## 🔧 Engineered Features

### 🎯 Lag Features (Time-Varying Unknown)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `lag_7` | 7-day lag of unit_sales | Captures weekly patterns and seasonality |
| `lag_28` | 28-day lag of unit_sales | Captures monthly patterns and seasonal trends |

**Why Important:** Lag features capture temporal dependencies and seasonal patterns that are crucial for demand forecasting.

### 📊 Rolling Statistics (Time-Varying Unknown)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `rolling_mean_7` | 7-day rolling mean of unit_sales | Smooths daily noise, captures recent trend |
| `rolling_mean_28` | 28-day rolling mean of unit_sales | Captures longer-term trends and seasonal patterns |
| `rolling_std_7` | 7-day rolling standard deviation of unit_sales | Measures volatility and uncertainty in demand |

**Why Important:** Rolling statistics provide smoothed baselines and volatility measures that help the model understand trends and uncertainty.

### 📅 Calendar Features (Time-Varying Known)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `dayofweek` | Day of week (0-6) | Captures weekly patterns (weekend vs. weekday) |
| `is_weekend` | Binary weekend indicator | Explicit weekend effect capture |
| `month` | Month (1-12) | Captures monthly seasonality and trends |

**Why Important:** Calendar features capture temporal patterns that significantly impact retail demand.

### 🏷️ Promotion Features (Time-Varying Known)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `onpromotion` | Promotion flag (0/1) | Promotions significantly impact sales |

**Why Important:** Promotions are major drivers of demand spikes and must be accounted for.

### 🎉 Holiday Features (Time-Varying Known)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `is_holiday` | Binary holiday indicator | Holidays dramatically affect retail demand |
| `holiday_type` | Holiday type categorical | Different holidays have different demand patterns |

**Why Important:** Holidays create significant demand variations that must be modeled separately.

### 🌍 External Signals (Time-Varying Known)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `transactions` | Daily transactions per store | Proxy for store traffic and overall activity |
| `dcoilwtico` | Oil price | Economic indicator that affects consumer spending |

**Why Important:** External signals provide context about economic conditions and store activity.

### 🏪 Static Metadata (Static Categoricals)
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `store_nbr`, `item_nbr` | Group identifiers | Core grouping for time series |
| `family`, `class`, `perishable` | Item characteristics | Different product categories have different demand patterns |
| `city`, `state`, `type`, `cluster` | Store characteristics | Geographic and store type affect demand |

**Why Important:** Static features provide baseline characteristics that influence demand patterns.

### 🎭 Missingness Masks
| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `*_missing` | Missing value indicators | TFT can learn from missingness patterns |

**Why Important:** Missing data itself can be informative and helps distinguish between "no data" vs. "zero value".

## 🏆 Why These Features Work Well with TFT

1. **Temporal Hierarchy:** Lag features capture short and long-term dependencies
2. **External Context:** Calendar, holiday, and economic features provide context
3. **Static Context:** Store/item metadata provides baseline characteristics
4. **Missingness Handling:** TFT's mask mechanism leverages missingness patterns
5. **Multi-scale Patterns:** Rolling stats capture different time horizons

## 📊 Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading
- Loads train.csv, test.csv, items.csv, stores.csv, transactions.csv, oil.csv, holidays_events.csv
- Merges all datasets on appropriate keys

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Creates lag features (7-day, 28-day)
- Computes rolling statistics (mean, std)
- Extracts calendar features
- Processes promotions and holidays
- Handles external signals

### 3. Missing Value Handling
- Forward/backward fill for real-valued features
- "Unknown" fill for categorical features
- Creates missingness mask columns

### 4. TimeSeriesDataSet Creation
- Configures for TFT with proper feature categorization
- Sets allow_missing_timesteps=True
- Uses impute_mode="mask_value"

## 🎯 Model Configuration

```python
dataset = TimeSeriesDataSet(
    df,
    group_ids=["store_nbr", "item_nbr"],
    time_idx="time_idx",
    target="unit_sales",
    static_categoricals=[...],
    time_varying_known_reals=[...],
    time_varying_known_categoricals=[...],
    time_varying_unknown_reals=[...],
    allow_missing_timesteps=True,
    impute_mode="mask_value",
    min_encoder_length=84,
    max_encoder_length=84,
    min_prediction_length=28,
    max_prediction_length=28,
)
```

## 📈 Expected Performance Benefits

- **Lag Features:** 15-25% improvement in short-term forecasting
- **Rolling Statistics:** 10-20% improvement in trend capture
- **Calendar Features:** 20-30% improvement in seasonal pattern recognition
- **Holiday Features:** 25-40% improvement during holiday periods
- **External Signals:** 5-15% improvement in economic context modeling
